# Simple Video Trailer Popup Website
This repository contains the code for a website that displays a video trailer in a modal popup window upon clicking a "Watch Now" button.

## Features
Interactive Video Popup: Clicking the "Watch Now" button triggers a modal popup displaying the video trailer. A close button allows users to dismiss the popup.
Movie Information: The website showcases a movie poster, title, synopsis, details like rating and year of release, and additional buttons like "Add To Watchlist." (Functionality for "Add To Watchlist" is not implemented in the provided code)
Responsive Design: The website adapts its layout for optimal viewing across different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the website content, including the main container, movie information sections, popup elements (video container, close button), and buttons.
CSS: Styles the website's appearance, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness for various screen sizes.
JavaScript: Controls the popup behavior. It listens for a click on the "Watch Now" button, displays the video popup, and handles closing the popup using the close button. It also resets the video playback when the popup is closed.
Usage

Open the Website: Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Customize (Optional):
Replace the placeholder video URL (Coco - Official US Trailer(1080P_HD).mp4) with the actual URL of your video trailer.
